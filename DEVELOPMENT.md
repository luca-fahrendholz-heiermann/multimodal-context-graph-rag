# Development Notes

This file collects internal development workflow notes in a public-safe format.

## Goals
- Keep the project portfolio-ready.
- Prefer conservative, non-breaking changes.
- Validate with tests/build checks before merging.

## Review checklist
- No secrets in code, docs, or config.
- No PII in fixtures and logs.
- README and docs updated when behavior changes.
